We develop custom processes to ensure maximal claim acceptance rates at every supported insurance company. However, this means that we cannot allow outside users to add companies. If you represent an insurance company and would like us to add support, please reach out to us at [info@bauxy.com](mailto:info@bauxy.com)!
